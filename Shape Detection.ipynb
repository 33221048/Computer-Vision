To determine which, we compute the aspect ratio of the shape, which is simply the width of the contour bounding box divided by the height. If the aspect ratio is ~1.0, then we are examining a square (since all sides have approximately equal length). Otherwise, the shape is a rectangle. Labelling a shape as a pentagon is straightforward, we just have to detect it has 5 sides. Ultimately, by process of elimination, we can assume that the analyzed shape is a circle.\n",
